## 📚 What You'll Learn

This folder is dedicated to mastering Python at a professional software engineering level. Knowing "how to code" isn't enough; an ML engineer must know how to build **scalable, efficient, and production-ready** systems.

### Core Topics
- ✅ **Expert Python**: Decorators, Generators, Context Managers, Asyncio.
- ✅ **Python OOP**: Advanced Class Structures, Design Patterns, SOLID Principles.
- ✅ **Major Libraries**: Deep dive into NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- ✅ **High Performance**: Multithreading, Multiprocessing, and Profiling.
- ✅ **Web APIs**: Building robust backends with **FastAPI** and Pydantic.
- ✅ **UI/UX for AI**: Rapidly building AI dashboards with **Streamlit**.
- ✅ **Software Engineering**: Pytest, Logging, Black, and Environment Management.

# Portfolio-Ready Projects 🚀

The best way to master Python for AI/ML is by building. This folder contains roadmaps and boilerplate for three major projects that cover the entire stack.

---

- [Project 1: AI Model Serving API](Project-1-AI-Model-API.md): FastAPI + ML.
- [Project 2: Interactive Data Explorer](Project-2-Data-Explorer.md): Streamlit + Pandas.
- [Project 3: Async Web Scraper](Project-3-Async-Scraper.md): Asyncio + Aiohttp.

## 🕸️ 3. High-Performance Web Scraper (Asyncio + Aiohttp)
Build a scraper that can fetch data from hundreds of URLs concurrently without blocking.

*   **Key Features**:
    *   Asynchronous request handling with `aiohttp`.
    *   Rate limiting to avoid getting blocked.
    *   Structured data extraction using BeautifulSoupr.
    *   Saving results to a CSV or JSON file.
*   **Tech Stack**: Asyncio, Aiohttp, BeautifulSoup4.

## 📈 Roadmap to Completion

1.  **Boilerplate**: Set up your environment (Poetry/Conda).
2.  **Core Logic**: Implement the main functionality (Model call, Data processing, Request loop).
3.  **Refactor**: Apply SOLID principles and OOP where beneficial.
4.  **Polish**: Add logging, error handling, and documentation.
5.  **Verify**: Write tests with Pytest to ensure stability.

# 07. Python Expert Projects 🛠️🚀

Hands-on projects to solidify your expert-level Python skills.

## Project 1: High-Performance Concurrent Scraper 🕷️🏎️
*   **Goal**: Build a web scraper that fetches data from 100+ URLs simultaneously without crashing or getting blocked.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, `BeautifulSoup`.
*   **Key Learning**: Managing concurrent HTTP requests, handling timeouts, and efficient parsing.

## Project 2: Production Model Inference API (FastAPI) 📡🧠
*   **Goal**: Create a robust API that serves a pre-trained ML model, including request validation, logging, and error handling.
*   **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, Pydantic, Scikit-learn/PyTorch.
*   **Key Learning**: Dependency injection, model serialization (Joblib/Pickle), and Pydantic schemas.

## Project 3: Real-time AI Dashboard (Streamlit) 🎈📊
*   **Goal**: Build an interactive dashboard that allows users to upload a CSV, perform automated EDA, and run multiple ML models to see results instantly.
*   **Tech Stack**: Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly.
*   **Key Learning**: Session state management, interactive widgets, and dynamic charting.

## Project 4: Database-Backed Task Manager (SQLAlchemy) 🗄️📜
*   **Goal**: A CLI tool that manages a local SQLite database using an ORM, allowing you to track your ML experiments or project tasks.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, SQLAlchemy, SQLite.
*   **Key Learning**: Database modeling, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and ORM benefits.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Architecture**: Don't just write code; design a **Folder Structure**. Separate your logic (utils), your data (models), and your interface (api/ui).
2.  **Environment**: Use **Poetry** or **Conda** to manage your dependencies. Never install global packages for projects.
3.  **Clean Code**: Run **Black** and **Flake8** on your project to ensure it matches the PEP8 standard used in professional teams.
